These functions return information about a file, in the buffer pointe to by statbuf. No permissions are required on the file itself, butâ€”
 Buffers are processed in array order.  This  means  that  readv()

The data transfers performed by readv() and writev() are  atomic the data written by writev() is written as a single block that is
stat() and fstatat() retrieve information about the file pointed to by pathname; the differences for fstatat() are described below.
Note: for performance and simplicity reasons, different fields in the stat structure may contain state information from  different  moments
during  the execution of the system call.  For example, if st_mode or st_uid is changed by another process by calling chmod(2) or chown(2),
stat() might return the old st_mode together with the new st_uid, or the old st_uid together with the new st_mode.
