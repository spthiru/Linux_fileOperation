Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks)[11] is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[12] an operating system kernel
 first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[13][14][15] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes
 the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word
 "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU
 software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[16][17]
Popular Linux distributions[18][19][20] include Debian, Fedora Linux, Arch Linux and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise
 Linux and SUSE Linux Eterprise. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as 
 GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is 
 freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.[21]
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 a
rchitecture, but has sin been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.[22] Because of the dominance of the Linux-based Android on
smartphones, Linux, includ Android, has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems, as of May 2022.[23][24][25] Although
Linux is, as of November2022,used by only around 2.6 percent of desktop computers,[26] the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based ChromeOS,
dominates the US K–12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[27] Linux is the leading operating
system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux),[28] leads other big iron systems such as mainframe
omputers, and is used on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers[d] (as of November 2017, having gradually displaced all competitors).[29:wq
Linux aso runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system.
Thisincludes routers, automation controls, smart home devices, video game consoles,[32] televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs),[33][34][35]
automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Toyota),[36] and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule and the Perseverance rover)
