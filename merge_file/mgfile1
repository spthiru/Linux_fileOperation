Over the period of these releases, the use and reputation of UNIX began to spread,
first within AT&T, and then beyond. An important contribution to this growing
awareness was the publication of a paper on UNIX in the widely read journal
Communications of the ACM ([Ritchie & Thompson, 1974]).
At this time, AT&T held a government-sanctioned monopoly on the US tele-
phone system. The terms of AT&T’s agreement with the US government prevented
it from selling software, which meant that it could not sell UNIX as a product.
Instead, beginning in 1974 with Fifth Edition, and especially with Sixth Edition,
AT&T licensed UNIX for use in universities for a nominal distribution fee. The
university distributions included documentation and the kernel source code (about
10,000 lines at the time).
AT&T’s release of UNIX into universities greatly contributed to the popularity
and use of the operating system, and by 1977, UNIX was running at some 500 sites,
including 125 universities in the United States and several other countries. UNIX
offered universities an interactive multiuser operating system that was cheap yet
powerful, at a time when commercial operating systems were very expensive. It also
gave university computer science departments the source code of a real operating
system, which they could modify and offer to their students to learn from and
experiment with. Some of these students, armed with UNIX knowledge, became
UNIX evangelists. Others went on to found or join the multitude of startup compa-
nies selling inexpensive computer workstations running the easily ported UNIX
operating system.
