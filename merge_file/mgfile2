In the meantime, US antitrust legislation forced the breakup of AT&T (legal
maneuvers began in the mid-1970s, and the breakup became effective in 1982),
with the consequence that, since it no longer held a monopoly on the telephone
system, the company was permitted to market UNIX. This resulted in the release of
System III (three) in 1981. System III was produced by AT&T’s UNIX Support
Group (USG), which employed many hundreds of developers to enhance UNIX
and develop UNIX applications (notably, document preparation packages and soft-
ware development tools). The first release of System V (five) followed in 1983, and

which time System V had incorporated many features from BSD, including net-

used it as the basis of their UNIX implementations.
Thus, in addition to the various BSD distributions spreading through aca-

Solaris, Digital’s Ultrix and OSF/1 (nowadays, after a series of renamings
